Under consideration 👨‍💻.

Still, there are a few rules:
- Each change accepted in form of [Pull Request][pr];
- Each Pull Request based on at least one [Issue][issue];
- Each Issue covers single Topic (new feature for example);
- Each Topic is unique, avoid duplicates;
- Each Contributor agrees on [Code Of Conduct][conduct].

[pr]: {{ github.pr }}
[issue]: {{ github.issue }}
[conduct]: {{ github.conduct }}
